## Hi there, I'm Annette <img src="https://iam-weijie.github.io/wave/hand-emoji.svg" alt="👋" width="40" height="30">

I'm an aspiring **Machine Learning specialist** with a solid foundation in Python and data analysis. I'm focused on turning raw data into meaningful insights and building models that help solve real problems. I believe in writing clean code, communicating clearly, and learning something new every day

-  **Current Focus:** Now I'm diving deep into **supervised learning algorithms** and **model evaluation techniques**
-  **My Goal:** To contribute to projects where I can apply my analytical skills to support **data-driven decisions**
-  **My approach:** I don't just learn, I build. Every concept I study gets applied in a small project

## Featured Project: My First End-to-End ML Journey

### [🍷 Red Wine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/TamagotchiFibi/red-wine-quality-prediction)

This is my first completed machine learning project, where I predicted wine quality based on physicochemical tests

In this project, I conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to uncover feature correlations. Then I built and compared multiple classification models with **scikit-learn**, and evaluated their performance using accuracy, precision, and recall to select the best approach

## What I'm Learning Next

- Diving deeper into **Feature Engineering** to improve model accuracy
- Exploring **Hyperparameter Tuning** techniques
- Getting started with **basic Deep Learning** concepts

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not working on ML, I like to challenge my brain in other ways:

- 🏋️‍♀️ **Gym** – staying active helps me stay focused and disciplined
- 💣 **Minesweeper** - I really enjoy this game. I love spotting new patterns and I'm currently working on improving my efficiency in **expert mode**
